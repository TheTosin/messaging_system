Step 1: Set Up Your Local Development Environment
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8+).
Install the required packages via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install RabbitMQ:

Install RabbitMQ on your system. If you are using Ubuntu, you can install RabbitMQ using the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```

Verify RabbitMQ Installation:

Confirm that RabbitMQ is running by checking its status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```

You can also access the RabbitMQ management interface by visiting http://localhost:15672 in your browser (use the default credentials: guest/guest).
Step 2: Configure Your Python Application
Application Overview:

The Python application consists of endpoints for sending emails and logging the current time. It uses Flask as the web framework, Celery for task management, and RabbitMQ as the message broker.
Create app.py:

Create the app.py file with the provided code. This script initializes a Flask application, configures Celery, and defines routes for sending emails (/) and fetching logs (/logs).
Update Your requirements.txt:

Ensure your requirements.txt includes the necessary packages:

Celery Configuration:

The application is configured to use RabbitMQ as the broker (pyamqp://guest@localhost//) and uses RPC for the result backend (rpc://).
SMTP Configuration:

The application uses Gmailâ€™s SMTP server to send emails. Ensure the credentials provided in the send_email_task function are correct.
Step 3: Set Up and Configure Nginx
Install Nginx:

Install Nginx on your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Create Nginx Configuration:

Configure Nginx to proxy requests to your Flask application running on port 5000.
Create or modify the Nginx configuration file (e.g., /etc/nginx/sites-available/default):

Test and Restart Nginx:

Test the Nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

Restart Nginx to apply the configuration:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Step 4: Run the Python Application with Celery
Start the Celery Worker:

In one terminal, start the Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
```

Run the Flask Application:

In another terminal, start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

Step 5: Expose Your Application via Ngrok (Optional)
Install Ngrok:

Download and install Ngrok from ngrok.com.
Start Ngrok:

Run Ngrok to expose your local application to the internet:
```bash
ngrok http 80
```

Ngrok will provide a public URL that you can use to access your application externally.
Step 6: Test the Endpoints
Send an Email:

Test the / endpoint with a sendmail parameter to queue an email task:
```bash
curl "http://localhost/?sendmail=mailto:recipient@example.com"
```

Log Current Time:

Test the / endpoint with a talktome parameter to log the current time:
```bash
curl "http://localhost/?talktome=now"
```

Fetch Logs:

Retrieve the logs by accessing the /logs endpoint:
```bash
curl "http://localhost/logs"
```

Step 7: Record the Setup Process
Screen Recording:

Use a screen recording tool (like OBS Studio) to capture your setup process, including:
Installing and configuring RabbitMQ and Celery.
Developing and running the Python application.
Configuring Nginx.
Testing the endpoints.
Exposing the application with Ngrok (if used).
